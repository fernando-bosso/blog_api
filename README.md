# Blog API in Phoenix

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged backend API with **Elixir and Phoenix** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo)** community style guides & best practices.
