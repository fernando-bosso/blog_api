# Blog Api in Elixir/Phoenix

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged backend application built with **Elixir and Phoenix** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo)** community styleguides & best practices.

## Installing / Getting started

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies on your system:

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
* [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/)

To get started, run the following commands in your project folder:

```shell
# creates the project's configuration file
cp config/dev.exs.example config/dev.exs

# installs the dependencies
mix deps.get

# creates the database.
mix ecto.create

# run the database migrations.
mix ecto.migrate

# run the application.
mix phx.server
```

This is a backend project, you won't be able to go to `localhost:4000` and see an application.

## Tests

To run the tests for this project, simply run in your terminal:

```shell
mix test
```

## Documentation

This will generate a `doc/` directory with a documentation in HTML. To view the documentation, open the `index.html` file in the generated directory.

## Style guide

This project uses [mix format](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/master/Mix.Tasks.Format.html). You can find the configuration file for the formatter in the `.formatter.exs` file.
